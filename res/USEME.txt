Here are the commands allowed by the program. Users should follow the syntax properly else the operation will not work correctly
 Let us assume there is a png imageData called 'test.png'. The below commands have been written in accordance to the imageData as mentioned.

1- load filePath test - loads the imageData at the given filePath and saves it in the program as test.

2 - save filePath test - takes the test imageData stored in the program and stores it at the provided filepath as the name and type provided in the filepath. If the path does not have the name of the outpit imageData and filetype, it will give an error.

3- brighten number imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs brighten operation with the number provided and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

4- sepia imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs sepia operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

5- horizontal-flip imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, flips the imageData horizontally and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

6-vertical-flip imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, flips the imageData vertically and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

7- red-component imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, converts it to its red-component and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

8- green-component imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, converts it to its green-component and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

9- blue-component imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, converts it to its blue-component and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

10- luma-component imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs luma operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

11- value-component imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs value operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

12- intensity-component imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs intensity operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

13 - blur imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs blur operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

14 - sharpen imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs sharpen operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

15- rgb-split imageName redImageName greenImageName blueImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs rgb-split operation and saves the 3 new images as redImageName greenImageName and blueImageName.

16 - rgb-combine newImageName redImageName greenImageName blueImageName - takes the imageName, redImageName, greenImageName and blueImageName stored in the program, performs rgb-combine operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

17- compress number imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs compress operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

18- histogram imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program,converts it to its histogram and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

19- color-correct imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs color-coorect operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.

20- levels-adjust b m w imageName newImageName - takes the imageName stored in the program, performs levels-adjust operation and saves the opearted imageData as newImageName.


Additionally, the program supports operation preview, where if you provide the command as shown below, the operation will only be performed on the percent provided in the command and will keep the redt of the imageData as is. Given below is an example on blur operation.

blur imageName newImageName split percent :  It will perform blur operation only on the percent value provided by the user and save the operated imageData as newImageName.

The commands which support operation preview are:
blur
sharpen
sepia
luma-component
intensity-component
value-component
color-correct
levels-adjust

The syntax for each of the command will not change, however if the user wants, he/she can provide split and percent to do operation preview.
