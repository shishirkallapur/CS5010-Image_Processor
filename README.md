# CS5010-Image_Processor

This README is for the Image Processing Application for Northeasten University's CS5010 course - Programming Design and Paradigm under Dr. Amit Shesh.The application has been designed with MVC architecture.The application takes in an image and performs an operation on the input image to produce a desired outcome. To start the GUI version, run the JAR File provided. The GUI will load up. If you would like to run the previous version of the application which is command line based application, please look at the commands given below

How to run the JAR file:
Place the JAR file in the root folder. Open a terminal inside the root folder to enter the commands. These 3 commands are supported:
 
1) java -jar GRIME.jar -file path-of-script-file : when invoked in this manner the program opens the script file provided by the path, executes the commands and then shuts down.

2) java -jar GRIME.jar -text : when invoked in this manner the program opens in an interactive text mode and allows the user to type the commands and execute it one line at a time(Please look at the USEME file for the valid syntax and commands allowed).

3)java -jar GRIME.jar : when invoked in this manner the program opens the graphical user interface. This is also what happens if one double-clicks on the jar file.
